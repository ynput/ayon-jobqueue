# JobQueue addon
Initial integration of this addon was to be able to process automated jobs of DCC applications that are hard to maintain via standard farm job submission. Like Photoshop, After Effects and TVPaint. But it was found out that even this approach was not reliable enough.

The addon is not maintained at this moment. It is still available for download and use.
